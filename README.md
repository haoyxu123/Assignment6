# Assignment6
This is creating linear regression model for CSV 'Boston". Creating linear regression models for concurrency and non-concurrency and comnpare thier execution time by running the each program 100 times

The execution time of non-currency program is longer than concureency's. 

# Advantage of Concureency
Increased Efficiency: Concurrency enables multiple processes to be executed simultaneously, which can significantly reduce the time required for large computations, such as training and testing multiple machine learning models.
Reduced Idle Time: By executing tasks in parallel, the overall idle time of the system is reduced, as the system can handle other tasks while waiting for I/O operations or other blocking events.
Complexity Management: Concurrency can simplify the management of complex, independent tasks by running them as separate concurrent processes.

# Advise for management
Concurrency in Go allows tasks to be executed concurrently, leveraging multiple CPU cores effectively. Company should use more concurrency and this will increase company's efficiency.
